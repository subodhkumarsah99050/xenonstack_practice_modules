=> Delete an image from a registry

For ACR,
-> This command will delete all image except latest 10 images from ACR.
acr purge --filter 'MyRepository:.*' \
                          --ago 0d --keep 10 --untagged


For ECR:
-> deletes all images tagged with prod and team1 in the specified repository.
aws ecr batch-delete-image \
    --repository-name MyRepository \
    --image-ids imageTag=prod imageTag=team1

Note: Is it possible to delete specified image from ECR and ACR as per your requirement.


=> Publish a port so that an application is accessible externally

$ docker run -itd -p 8080:80 --name container_name image_name

=> Identify which IP and port a container is externally accessible on
$ docker ps
$ docker container inspect container_ids


=> Describe the difference between "host" and "ingress" port publishing mode

-> Ingress mode is the default service publishing mode. It's ideal when you have multiple replicas of a service and need to load balance between them. Host mode publishing is useful when you have an external service discovery service and potentially for global services where one task for a service runs on each node. 


=> Describe the process of signing an image
-> To sign a Docker Image you will need a delegation key pair. These keys can be generated locally using $ docker trust key generate or generated by a certificate authority. First we will add the delegation private key to the local Docker trust repository.

=> Container logging and troubleshooting
$ docker exec -it container_IDs /bin/bash
$$ free -m 
$$ df -Th
$ docker logs container_IDs
