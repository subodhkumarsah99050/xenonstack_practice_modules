=> Describe how image deletion works

-> Process to deletion an image:
1. First you need to list all image and get the image IDs, Image name and other details.
$ docker images -a
$docker image ls

After that you need to select those image you want to delete. That image IDs
$ docker rmi -f <your-image-id>
or, 
$ docker image rm -f <your-image-id>

=> Utilize a registry to store an image

-> I have created a docker hub registry and stored my test image there.


=> Display layers of a Docker image

$ docker history image_id/image_name
$ docker image history image_id/image_name
$ docker history --no-trunc image_id/image_name

=> Modify an image to a single layer
